## Personalize

You can set personal favorites by clicking the star icon.

In the settings mode you can add a group name to a repository. Group names will show up as 'tabs' at the top to quickly navigate to the set of repositories you are looking for.

You can also hide specific branches so they won't show up in the overview.
